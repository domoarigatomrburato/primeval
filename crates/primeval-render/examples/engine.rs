//!                       (`joint::Settings::curved`, default on; `off`

//!                       rounds and 1 time the age, 2 for quadratics)
//!   --refine-effort R:A every refit pass's hill climbs per layer and the
//!                       non-improving moves that stop a climb (default:
//!                       the model's, 4 climbs of age 25)
//!   --quadratic-width MIN:MAX  the bounds of every quadratic curve's
//!                       stroke width in working pixels, 1 <= MIN <= MAX
//!                       (`Model::set_quadratic_width`, default: the
//!                       model's 2:6; 2:2 reproduces the earlier fixed
//!                       2 px); for every kind, it only affects
//!                       quadratics, in `quadratic` and `any`
//! ```
//!
//! For every image × shape kind it runs one greedy search to the largest
//! checkpoint, with seed 42 and default options otherwise. It drives
//! [`primeval_core::Model`] itself through `primeval_render::lab`, which
//! reproduces `approximate`'s search and encoding exactly. `approximate`
//! runs the pipeline of its kind (`lab::pipeline`): refit passes during the
//! search, then its final stage: for triangles, polygons, rectangles and
//! rotated rectangles the joint gradient optimisation of every shape
//! (`primeval_core::joint`), for `any` one refit pass then the joint
//! optimisation, whose result is kept only if its PNG at the working size
//! is closer to the target than its input, for quadratics refit passes
//! until one gains less than 1%, at most four, for every other kind one
//! refit pass. The rows of
//! `--refine final` are what it returns for that step count; rows without
//! `--refine` are the greedy search alone. At each checkpoint it records
//! one row.
//!
//! With `--refine end:P`, each checkpoint clones the model, runs `P` refit
//! passes on the clone and records the clone, while the search itself goes
//! on greedily: each row is "greedy to n steps, then P passes". With
//! `--refine final`, the search itself runs the pipeline's refit passes
//! (`lab::after_step`), and each checkpoint runs its final stage on a clone
//! (`lab::final_stage`) and records its drawing, in the same way. With
//! `--refine every:K` the search itself runs one pass after every `K`-th
//! step, so later steps build on the refitted shapes; `--during` gives any
//! other `--refine` such passes too. With `--refine joint:R`, each
//! checkpoint runs `lab::final_stage` on a clone with `R` refit passes (none
//! with `joint:0`), then the joint optimisation. Passes and the final stage
//! get the render's alpha. A schedule of passes during the search depends
//! only on the step number, never on the shape count, so a checkpoint of a
//! longer search is what `approximate` returns for that count.
//!
//! Progress goes to stderr; stdout gets a header with the commit, the
//! machine, the options and the refine schedule, the rows as a Markdown
//! table sorted by image, shape and steps, and two summary tables, so two
//! runs can be compared at a glance: one line per checkpoint over all rows,
//! then one line per shape kind × checkpoint.
//!
//! Corpus: the same as the `quality` runner, the public-domain paintings
//! `docs/readme/originals/monalisa.jpg` and `americangothic.jpg` plus three
//! deterministic 512 × 512 images (`synthetic-gradient`, `synthetic-shapes`,
//! `synthetic-texture`), all in `common/mod.rs`. Inputs are expected to be
//! opaque.
//!
//! Terms used below:
//!
//! - the *working target* is the thumbnail the engine optimises, with the
//!   default `resize_input` of 256 (`lab::working_target`; the runner reads
//!   its pixels through `lab::working_image`, which shares its code path). Its longer side is 256 px for every input of the default
//!   corpus; an input already smaller than that is used at its own size.
//! - *normalised RGB RMSE* between two images of the same size is
//!   `sqrt(Σ Δ² / (w · h · 3)) / 255`, over the RGB channels of every
//!   pixel, as in the `quality` runner. Lower is better.
//! - *SSIM* is mean SSIM (Wang et al. 2004): each RGB channel is scored
//!   separately with an 11 × 11 Gaussian window (σ = 1.5, normalised to
//!   sum 1), `K1 = 0.01`, `K2 = 0.03`, `L = 255`, over the window positions
//!   inside the image; the value is the mean of the three channels' mean
//!   SSIM maps (`lab::ssim`). Higher is better; `1` is identical.
//! - *the PNG at size s* is the PNG `approximate` would return for the
//!   drawing with `output_size` s (`lab::encode`): the vector drawing
//!   rendered anti-aliased with tiny-skia, its longer side s px.
//!
//! Columns:
//!
//! - `search_s`: cumulative wall time of the `Model::step` calls up to this
//!   checkpoint, plus the refit passes: every pass during the search so
//!   far (`every:K` or `--during`, joint passes included), and with `end:P`
//!   this checkpoint's passes, with `final` or `joint:R` this checkpoint's
//!   final stage.
//!   Decoding, the thumbnail, the clone, the
//!   metrics and the encodings are outside the clock, as are all the
//!   columns below.
//! - `refine_s`, only with `--refine`: the part of `search_s` spent in
//!   refit passes or the final stage.
//! - `score`: `Model::score_f64`, the normalised RGB RMSE between the
//!   engine's own canvas and the working target. Most shape kinds draw on
//!   that canvas with binary (not anti-aliased) coverage. With `--refine
//!   final` or `joint:R`, the score `lab::final_stage` returns: after the joint optimisation, its model's RMSE of its exported
//!   drawing (`joint::score`), so `gap` measures how well that model agrees
//!   with the export.
//! - `rmse256`: the normalised RGB RMSE between the PNG at the working
//!   target's longer side, which has exactly the working target's
//!   dimensions (scale 1 against the drawing's view box; the runner
//!   asserts the dimensions), and the working target itself. It is
//!   `score` measured on the exported image instead of the engine's canvas.
//! - `gap`: `rmse256 / score − 1`, signed. Positive means the exported image
//!   is further from the target than the engine believes; negative, closer.
//! - `ssim128`: SSIM between the PNG at size 128 and the input resampled to
//!   the same dimensions with Catmull-Rom, the filter the engine uses for
//!   its working thumbnail: the quality at a placeholder-like size.
//! - `ssim1024`: the same at the default output size, 1024 (the `ssim`
//!   column of earlier runs).
//! - `svg_bytes`: the length in bytes of the SVG output at the default
//!   output size.
//! - `adopted`, with `--during joint:K:C:I` or `joint-export:K:C:I`: the
//!   joint passes during the search up to this checkpoint whose result the
//!   model adopted, over those that ran, as `kept/ran`; empty for a
//!   schedule without joint passes. Their time is in `search_s` and
//!   `refine_s`, as every pass's during the search.
//! - `final_joint`, with `--refine final` or `joint:R`: `kept` when the
//!   checkpoint's final stage returned the joint optimisation's result,
//!   `input` when the guard kept the refitted drawing because the joint
//!   result exported no closer to the target (`lab::Chosen`); empty for a
//!   kind without the joint optimisation and for the other `--refine`.
//! - `violations`, in the per-kind summary only: the drawing's shapes that
//!   break the legibility rules, checked independently with `acos` angles:
//!   triangles with an angle of 15° or less; quadrilaterals (polygons
//!   and rotated rectangles) whose diagonals do not cross strictly, that is
//!   not strictly convex, or with an angle of 15° or less; and rectangles,
//!   axis-aligned or rotated, with a side under 1 px or a long side more
//!   than 8 times the short one. With `rotated-rectangle`, a quadrilateral
//!   that is not a rectangle is one too.
//!
//! Summaries. The median of an even number of values is the mean of the two
//! middle ones.
//!
//! - Per checkpoint, over all rows: the number of rows, the mean and median
//!   of `score`, the medians of `rmse256` and `gap`, the means of `ssim128`,
//!   `ssim1024` and `svg_bytes`, and the sum of `search_s` (and of
//!   `refine_s` with `--refine`).
//! - Per shape kind × checkpoint, over that kind's rows (one per image),
//!   kinds in the order `any`, `triangle`, `rectangle`, `ellipse`, `circle`,
//!   `rotated-rectangle`, `quadratic`, `rotated-ellipse`, `polygon`: the
//!   medians of `score`, `rmse256`, `gap` and `ssim128`, the mean of
//!   `svg_bytes`, the sum of `search_s` (and of `refine_s` with
//!   `--refine`), and the sum of `violations`.
//!
//! Times vary between runs. Every other column is deterministic for a given
//! commit and platform, whatever the thread count (the search runs one
//! worker per logical core, but its result does not depend on how many
//! there are).
