//! Joint gradient optimisation of a drawing's triangles, convex polygons,
//! rectangles, rotated or not, ellipses, circles and rotated ellipses, with
//! every other layer (the quadratics) fixed in geometry.
//!
//! The greedy search places one shape at a time with the others fixed.
//! [`optimise`] then moves every vertex of every triangle and polygon, every
//! side of every rectangle, the centre, half-side vector and half-width of
//! every rotated rectangle, and every opacity under [`Alpha::Auto`], at
//! once: Adam on the gradient of the squared error between the composite
//! and the target, through a smooth model of the export's anti-aliased
//! rendering, with every colour refitted at each iteration. The step sizes
//! ramp up over the first iterations ([`Tuning::warmup`]), so that Adam's
//! first updates, a full step on every coordinate whatever the gradient,
//! do not wreck small, well-placed shapes. Its result is
//! snapped to a quarter pixel (half a pixel for axis-aligned rectangles)
//! and keeps the engine's rules: every angle of a triangle above 15°, every
//! polygon strictly convex with every angle above 15°, and every rectangle
//! with sides of at least 1 px, the long one at most 8 times the short one.
//!
//! With [`Settings::curved`], on by default, ellipses, circles and rotated
//! ellipses move too: the centre and radii of each, and a rotated
//! ellipse's semi-axis vector, which carries its angle. A circle stays a
//! circle and an axis-aligned ellipse axis-aligned, since they have no
//! parameter to become anything else; their results are snapped to a
//! quarter pixel with radii of at least 1 px, the greedy search's bound.
//! Every other layer (the quadratics, and with `curved` off the curved
//! shapes too) keeps its geometry. Its opacity and colour are optimised
//! with the others', through a coverage mask of the engine's own
//! rasterization of the shape, computed once.
//!
//! The forward model (`diff.rs`) covers each pixel of a triangle, a
//! polygon or a rotated rectangle by its exact area in the pixel square:
//! one edge's half-plane area where only that edge cuts the square, the
//! square clipped to the inside of the cutting edges near a vertex; and of
//! an axis-aligned rectangle by the product of its sides', which is its
//! exact area there; and of a curved layer by the box-filtered half-plane
//! of its boundary taken as locally straight in the pixel; it composites
//! in `f32`. A rotated rectangle is parametrised without
//! trigonometry, by its centre `c`, a half-side vector `u` and its
//! half-width `h`, its corners `c ± u ± (h / |u|) · (−u_y, u_x)` computed
//! with `sqrt` alone. Reverse-mode gradients replay the layer
//! stack from canvas checkpoints, about `√N` of them for `N` layers, capped
//! in memory as the refit pass's are. Every pass runs as one task per fixed
//! band of rows, with one fork and join, and its sums are reduced in band
//! order, so the result does not depend on the number of threads. The
//! colours are refitted together, each by a step towards its closed-form
//! fit that can only lower the loss. The rules are kept by a projection
//! after every step and by the snap (`angle.rs` for triangles, `convex.rs`
//! for polygons, `rect.rs` for rectangles, `ellipse.rs` for the curved
//! layers).
//!
//! # Arithmetic
//!
//! Native and WebAssembly builds must produce bit-identical output, and
//! their math libraries differ. Everything this module computes, the
//! projection and the snap included, may therefore use only:
//!
//! - `+ − × ÷` and `sqrt`, which IEEE 754 rounds exactly;
//! - comparisons, `abs`, `min` and `max`;
//! - `floor`, `ceil`, `round` and `trunc`;
//! - constants written as literals.
//!
//! Never `hypot`, `atan2`, `acos`, `cos`, `sin`, `tan`, `exp`, `ln`,
//! `powi`, `powf` or `mul_add`, whose results can differ in the last bit
//! between platforms. Tests may use them. The masks of the fixed layers
//! are not computed here: they are the scanlines of the engine's
//! rasterizers, which the greedy search's own output already depends on,
//! and which the native–wasm tripwire test covers. A rotated rectangle's
//! starting `u` needs the sine and cosine of the greedy search's integer
//! angle: they come from a Taylor polynomial in `+ − × ÷`
//! (`crate::util::sin_cos_degrees`), the one the greedy search's corners
//! come from, not from the platform's `sin_cos`, so B's input is the same
//! on every platform even where the platforms' `sin_cos` differ in the
//! last bit; so does a rotated ellipse's starting semi-axis vector, from
//! its continuous angle, and its exported rotation, the angle of that
//! vector, comes from `rect::atan2_degrees`, a polynomial in `+ − × ÷`
//! too. The exported rotated ellipse is then drawn through
//! `sin_cos_degrees` as well, as the greedy search's are.
